# Flight Management System

## Overview

The **Flight Management System** is a Java-based application that allows users to manage various types of flights, including passenger flights, cargo flights, and private flights. The system provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a console-based interface for entering, displaying, searching, filtering, and sorting flight information. The application is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, making it easy to handle different types of flights and operations.
